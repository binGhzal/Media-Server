# Media-Server

## Introduction

This repository contains the configuration files and scripts for setting up a media server using Docker and Kubernetes. The server is designed to host various applications and services, including media streaming, network management, monitoring, and more.
The goal is to create a self-hosted environment that can be easily managed and scaled.

## Features

- Media streaming applications (e.g., Jellyfin, Plex)
- Network management tools (e.g., Bind9)
- Monitoring and reporting tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
- IoT integration (e.g., Home Assistant)
- Automation tools (e.g., Ansible, OpenTofu)
- Security and identity management (e.g., Wazuh, ClamAV)
- Code management and CI/CD (e.g., Git, GitHub Actions)
- App and service management (e.g., Portainer, Dockege)
- Database management (e.g., PostgreSQL, MariaDB, InfluxDB)
- Container management and orchestration (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- Reverse proxy and load balancing (e.g., Traefik)
- SSL certificate management (e.g., Cert-manager)
- Remote access and VPN (e.g., TwinGate)

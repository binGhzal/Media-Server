# Proxmox Template Creator - Progress Tracker

This document tracks the progress of implementing features, fixing issues, and planning future enhancements for the Proxmox Template Creator project.

## Recent Updates

**Latest Update**: Phase 3 Implementation Complete (December 2024)

- **Phase 3A**: Terraform automation module fully implemented with complete menu functionality
- **Phase 3B**: Ansible automation module fully implemented with comprehensive playbook creation
- **Phase 3C**: Infrastructure monitoring components enhanced with Alertmanager integration
- All major automation features now operational with proper error handling and user interfaces

## Implementation Strategy

The project follows a modular implementation strategy with each component developed independently and integrated through well-defined interfaces. The implementation is divided into phases, with each phase building upon the previous ones.

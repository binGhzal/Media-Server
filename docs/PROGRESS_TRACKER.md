# Proxmox Template Creator - Progress Tracker

This document tracks the progress of implementing features, fixing issues, and planning future enhancements for the Proxmox Template Creator project.

## Implementation Strategy

The project follows a modular implementation strategy with each component developed independently and integrated through well-defined interfaces. The implementation is divided into phases, with each phase building upon the previous ones.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Bootstrap Process

The bootstrap process is the critical entry point for the entire system, designed to be invoked with a single curl command. The implementation will focus on:

#### 1. Single-Command Installation

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binghzal/homelab/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | sudo bash
```

This command downloads the bootstrap script and executes it with root privileges. The bootstrap script will:

- Verify root privileges
- Check for required dependencies
- Install missing dependencies
- Clone or update the repository
- Set up configuration directories
- Configure logging
- Launch the main application

#### 2. Auto-Update Mechanism

The auto-update system ensures the application is always running the latest version:

- Regular checks for updates (configurable frequency)
- Safe application of updates with backup of user configurations
- Rollback capability if update fails
- User notification of available updates
- Optional automatic updates

#### 3. Module Integration

The modular architecture allows for flexible and extensible development:

- Each module is self-contained in its own script
- Modules communicate through standardized interfaces
- Main controller coordinates module loading and execution
- Event-driven communication between modules
- Dynamic loading of modules based on user selection

### Implementation Milestones

1. **Phase 1: Core Bootstrap and Template Creation**

   - Bootstrap script with dependency management
   - Basic whiptail UI framework
   - Core template creation functionality
   - Configuration persistence system

2. **Phase 2: Container and Module System**

   - Docker integration
   - Kubernetes setup
   - Module communication framework
   - Registry setup

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**

   - Terraform integration
   - Ansible integration
   - Monitoring stack
   - Comprehensive UI

4. **Phase 4: Polish and Performance**
   - Performance optimizations
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - User workflow improvements
   - Extended template library

## Security Implementation

Security is a primary concern for the system, especially since it runs with root privileges. The implementation will include:

### Authentication and Authorization

- Root privilege verification
- Secure credential storage using encrypted configuration
- Principle of least privilege for operations

### File Security

- Proper file permissions (640 for configs, 750 for scripts)
- Secure temporary file handling with proper cleanup
- Validation of all file content

### Network Security

- HTTPS for all external communications
- Verification of downloaded content with checksums
- Certificate validation for secure connections

### Input Validation

- Sanitization of all user inputs
- Parameter validation before execution
- Protection against command injection and other attacks

## Error Handling Strategy

The system implements comprehensive error handling to ensure reliability:

### Logging System

- Structured log format with timestamps and levels
- Rotating log files with compression
- Different log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
- Configurable verbosity

### Recovery Mechanisms

- Transaction-based operations with rollback
- Checkpoints during complex operations
- State tracking for resumable operations
- Automatic recovery attempts for common failures

### User Feedback

- Clear, actionable error messages
- Suggested next steps for resolution
- Detailed debug information when needed
- Progress tracking for long-running operations
